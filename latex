Stochastic FRG Gravity: Minimal Scaffold

Status: Structural template. No physical claims.

1. Action ansatz

Gravity with curvature-squared terms and matter placeholders.

2. FRG flow

Define couplings, truncations, and symbolic beta-structure.

3. Stochastic sector

Einsteinâ€“Langevin form with Gaussian noise placeholder.

4. Tomography

Geodesic X-ray operator under weak-field linearization. Placeholder.

5. Computation plan

List modules mapping to code scaffold.

6. Reproducibility

Seeds, tolerances, mesh sizes, and identity checks (to be filled).
